Using matplotlib
This lab makes use of various functions of matplotlib. Matplotlib allows the programming to very simply create graphs of data in a variety of ways. It has many useful functions that allow easy methods to plot multiple data sets, has various line styles.

Matplotlib could be useful in a variety of data analysis applications. The first thing that comes to mind for me is: it would be useful if you wanted map the movement of a something. Also would be very useful if applied in project that took sensor readings and you wished to view a graph of that data. My final project is a carbonation controller that is used to carbonate beer. I believe that matplotlib could be useful in expanding the capabilites of this project by adding the functionallity to monitor the brewing process even further. The brewer might want to view the temperature and pressure over the course of the brewing process because sudden changes in temperature due to errors in the cooling system could result in reducing the quality of the beer.
